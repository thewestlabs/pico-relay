# Pico Relay with voltage sensor and RTC
DIY Programmable relay with voltage sensor and real time clock for Raspberry Pi Pico. It can measure input voltage (max 30v dc) and has a high precision real time clock chip DS3231 (this chip is expensive atm). So you can program your relay based on voltage and/or time. Sample micropython code is provided for programming Raspberry Pi Pico (Pico not included). The circuit is powered by 5v-30v dc input and the relay can handle 110v/220v AC up to 6A.
